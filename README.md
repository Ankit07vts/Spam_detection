# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Description
Spam Detection using Machine Learning is a project that aims to identify and filter out spam messages or emails from a given dataset. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to create a model that can classify messages as either spam or not spam (ham).

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the text data for machine learning.
- **Feature Extraction:** Text data is converted into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Model Building:** Various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models, are implemented to build a spam classification model.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Integration:** The project can be integrated into email clients or messaging apps for real-time spam detection.
Usage
-  Train the model with a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam messages.
-  Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
-  Use the trained model to classify incoming messages or emails as spam or not spam.
-  Implement the spam detection functionality in your email client or messaging application.
Technologies Used
-  Python
-  Scikit-learn
-  Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
-  Machine Learning algorithms
